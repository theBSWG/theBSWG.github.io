There are a large number of bridge conventions and variants of them.  None are yet catalogued or indexed as a standard, nor assigned an ID from a family of identifiers.  Chess has such a system for Openings (ECO).

## Use cases
- A Player using an online System Note builder inputs a Convention name, which offers variants, one is chosen, and using its ID the required Convention is auto-downloaded as a System Notes snippet.
- A bridge convention Website lists the appropriate index for each of its conventions. 

## Examples

bridgebum.com , bridgehands.com, bridgeguys.com  acbl.org, rpbridge.net , Simonâ€™s Conventions
