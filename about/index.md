The Bridge Standards Working Group is a voluntary organization of businesses, nonprofits, and individuals which exists to create Recommendations. Recommendations are standards that define how bridge applications (such as robots, convention card editors, and tournament managers) interwork. BSWG Recommendations are non-binding; however they are generally complied with due to their high quality and because they guarantee the interconnectivity of applications and enable bridge services to be provided on a worldwide scale.
