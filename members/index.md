## Overview ##
Membership is not necessary to be involved with developing standards with the BSWG - you can join our Discord server and start collaborating right away.  A weekly roundup and important announcements can be viewed on the publicly accessible group - [https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/bswg.org/g/members](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/bswg.org/g/members)

## Benefits ##

However there are additional benefits by being a Member, which is open to all.

Members....
* can collaborate and edit subGroup (standards) documents
* can request to vote on standards
* are part of the members@bswg.org email group and receive announcements and updates by email
