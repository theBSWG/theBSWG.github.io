# Bridge Standards Working Group

#### Status
Norming. Members and participants are figuring out structures and working on formats.

### Primary Goal
To publish and maintain normative recommendations to benefit bridge players, organisations and businesses, which if adopted by the Bridge industry will become de facto standards. 

### What are Standards and why are they Important?
