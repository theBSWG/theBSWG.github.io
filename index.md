### Primary Goal
To create and maintain an independent, active, non-profit organisation dedicated to ensuring their are technical standards in the world of Bridge, in particular online systems.

### What are Standards and why are they Important?
“*Standards form the fundamental building blocks for product development by establishing consistent protocols that can be universally understood and adopted. This helps fuel compatibility and interoperability and simplifies product development, and speeds time-to-market.*”

### How can Standards help grow the business and mindsport of Bridge?
The growth of digital Bridge software and services, serving a surge of interest, usage and demand from Bridge players, means an increasingly crowded marketplace of systems that, with few exceptions, can not interoperate with each other efficiently, if at all.
